The Simon Game is a classic memory game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The objective of the game is to replicate a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the computer. With each round, the sequence becomes progressively longer and more challenging, testing the playerâ€™s memory and concentration.

**How to Play:**

1. Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
2. Watch the sequence of colors and listen to the sounds.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons.
4. The game continues until you make a mistake.

This project is a great way to practice JavaScript and DOM manipulation, and it provides a fun and engaging way to improve your coding skills.
